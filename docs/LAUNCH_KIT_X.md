# Dockyard Launch Kit (X / Twitter)

Use this page to publish Dockyard with a proof-first narrative.

## 1) Positioning line

> Dockyard is an engineering memory layer for git repos: save context, resume
> instantly, and search decisions across branches.

## 2) 10-post launch thread (draft)

1. **Hook:** Most engineering time isn’t coding — it’s reloading context.
2. **Pain:** Teams forget why decisions were made after context switches.
3. **Solution:** Dockyard checkpoints objective, decisions, next steps, and risks.
4. **Workflow:** `save` → `harbor` → `search` → `resume`.
5. **Speed:** Resume context in seconds, not hours.
6. **Safety:** Non-invasive by default; explicit run modes only for command execution.
7. **Reliability:** Large integration and non-interference coverage.
8. **Automation:** JSON output modes for tooling and agent workflows.
9. **Who it helps:** solo builders, startups, async teams, AI-assisted loops.
10. **CTA:** “Reply DOCK for quickstart.”

## 3) Carousel deck structure (8 slides)

1. Context switching tax is real.
2. What Dockyard is.
3. 4-command workflow demo.
4. Safety boundary.
5. Reliability proof signals.
6. Metrics that matter (TTC, latency, non-interference).
7. Current product state and next steps.
8. CTA + quickstart command.

## 4) Proof checklist before posting
